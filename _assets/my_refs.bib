  abstract     = {The circumcentered-reflection method (CRM) has been applied for solving convex feasibility problems. CRM iterates by computing a circumcenter upon a composition of reflections with respect to convex sets. Since reflections are based on exact orthogonal projections, their computation might be costly. In this regard, we introduce the circumcentered approximate-reflection method (CARM), whose reflections rely on outer-approximate projections. The appeal of CARM is that, in rather general situations, the approximate projections we employ are available under low computational cost. We derive convergence of CARM and linear convergence under an error bound condition. We also present successful theoretical and numerical comparisons of CARM to the original CRM, to the classical method of alternating projections (MAP) and to a correspondent outer-approximate version of MAP, referred to as MAAP. Along with our results and numerical experiments, we present a couple of illustrative examples.},

In this paper, we apply CRM to the more general Fixed Point Problem (denoted as FPP), consisting of finding a common fixed-point of operators belonging to a larger family of operators, namely firmly nonexpansive operators. We prove than in this setting, CRM is globally convergent to a common fixed-point (supposing at least one exists). We also establish linear convergence of the sequence generated by CRM applied to FPP, under a not too demanding error bound assumption, and provide an estimate of the asymptotic constant. We provide solid numerical evidence of the superiority of CRM when compared to the classical Parallel Projections Method (PPM). Additionally, we present certain results of convex combination of orthogonal projections, of some interest on its own.},

Going back to names such as Kaczmarz and von Neumann, MAP has the ability to track a pair of points realizing minimum distance between two given closed convex sets. Unfortunately, MAP may suffer from arbitrarily slow convergence, and sublinear rates are essentially only surpassed in the presence of some Lipschitzian error bound, which is our first ingredient. The second one is a seemingly unfavorable and unexpected condition, infeasibility. For two non-intersecting closed convex sets satisfying an error bound, we establish finite convergence of MAP. In particular, MAP converges in finitely many steps when applied to a polyhedron and a hyperplane in the case in which they have empty intersection. Moreover, the farther the target sets lie from each other, the fewer are the iterations needed by MAP for finding a best approximation pair. Our results are accompanied by insightful examples and further theoretical discussions.},

It turns out that CRM skillfully tackles the reformulated problem. We also show that for a point in the affine set the CRM iteration is always closer to the solution set than both the MAP and DRM iterations.

In this work, we prove that there exists an easily reachable region consisting of what we refer to as centralized points, where pure circumcenter steps possess properties yielding convergence.

In this paper we take a different route as we present an augmented Lagrangian method for convex quadratic programming based on recent developments for nonlinear programming. In our approach, box constraints are penalized while equality constraints are kept within the subproblems. The motivation for this approach is that Newton’s method can be efficient for minimizing a piecewise quadratic function. Moreover, since augmented Lagrangian methods do not rely on proximity to the central path, some of the inherent difficulties in interior point methods can be avoided. In addition, a good starting point can be easily exploited, which can be relevant for solving subproblems arising from sequential quadratic programming, in sensitivity analysis and in branch and bound techniques. We prove well-definedness and finite convergence of the method proposed. Numerical experiments on separable strictly convex quadratic problems formulated from the Netlib collection show that our method can be competitive with interior point methods, in particular when a good initial point is available and a second-order Lagrange multiplier update is used.},

  abstract   = {In this study, show how to accelerate the spherical triangle algorithm (S-TA), a geometrical algorithm, recently introduced to solve the convex hull membership problem (CHMP). S-TA is a modification of Triangle Algorithm, which has its foundation on a theorem of alternatives, known as distance duality and its iteration mechanism is quite similar to a iteration of the well-now conditional gradient (Frank-Wolfe) method. Although S-TA convergence rate, for general problems, is (1/ε2) , an improved iteration complexity of (M/ε) , with M≥1  was recently presented by [Kalantari and Zhang, ACM Trans. Math. Softw., 2022], under a mild assumption, called ε -property, that an iterate must comply. We propose here a heuristic that provides an iterate which satisfy the ε -property and show numerical results revealing that this heuristic has advantages, when compared with both TA and S-TA.},

Demand response is currently being tested by the Brazilian independent system operator and by the trading chamber, ONS. The program considers reductions of consumption of some clients as an alternative to dispatching thermal power plants out of the merit order. The day-ahead problem of finding optimal dispatch and prices for the Brazilian system is modelled as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, with non-convexities related to fixed costs and minimal generation requirements for some thermal power plants. The work focuses on the point of view of an individual hydro-power generator, to determine business opportunities related to adhering to a demand response program.},

  abstract    = {Resumo: O objetivo deste trabalho é propor um modelo utilizando Sistemas Baseados em Regras Fuzzy (SBRF) que possa controlar, do ponto de vista teόrico, uma determinada espécie, considerada como praga em uma lavoura ou plantação. Faz-se primeiro uma introdução à Teoria dos Conjuntos Fuzzy, bem como aos sistemas especialistas fuzzy que utilizam regras de inferência, através do método de inferência de Mamdani e que utilizem o método de defuzzificação por centro de massa. Logo apόs, são abordados os conceitos de Sistemas Dinâmicos P-Fuzzy uni e bidimensionais desenvolvidos por Silva [24] e Cecconelo [7]. Έ proposto um novo tipo de Sistema Dinâmico P-fuzzy para modelar a dinâmica populacional, de uma espécie ou de um sistema presa-predador, que leve em conta fatores extrínsecos da(s) espécie(s) envolvida(s). Estes fatores são representados por uma Condição Ambiental, que é definida e acoplada aos Sistemas P-fuzzy usuais. Ainda, usando um controlador fuzzy propomos um sistema de controle híbrido com controladores biolόgicos e químicos (biocidas) em que as espécies que interagem estão sujeitas também às condições ambientais. Simulações e experimentos computacionais feitos com o auxílio da Fuzzy Logic Toolbox do software Matlab são realizados e seus resultados são comentados.},

We also gen- eralize Gondzios symmetric neighborhood, and the merit function is subjected to this neighborhood. A constrained global optimization problem results from this method and its solution leads to a good direction. Numerical experiments and comparisons to PCx are performed.},

A minimização da função de mérito é feita sujeitando-a à restrições definidas por uma vizinhança da trajetόria central que permite passos largos. Dessa maneira, combinamos diferentes direções, tais como preditora, corretora e de centralização com o objetivo de obter uma direção melhor. O método proposto generaliza grande parte dos métodos de pontos interiores preditores-corretores, a depender da escolha do valor das variáveis acima descritas. Έ feita, então uma análise de convergência do método proposto, considerando um ponto inicial que tem bom desempenho na prática, e que resulta em convergência linear dos iterados em complexidade polinomial. São feitos experimentos numéricos, utilizando o conjunto de testes Netlib, que mostram que essa abordagem é competitiva, quando comparada a implementações de pontos interiores bem estabelecidas como o PCx},

  abstract     = {A very important area of research in the field of Mathematical Optimization is the benchmarking of optimization packages to compare solvers. During benchmarking, one usually collects a large amount of information like CPU time, number of functions evaluations, number of iterations, and much more. This information, if presented as tables, can be difficult to analyze and compare due to large amount of data. Therefore tools to better process and understand optimization benchmark data have been developed. One of the most widespread tools is the Performance Profile graphics proposed by Dolan and Moré [2]. In this context, this paper describes perprof-py, a free/open source software that creates ¡em¿Performance Profile¡/em¿ graphics. This software produces graphics in PDF using LaTeX with PGF/TikZ [22] and PGFPLOTS [4] packages, in PNG using matplotlib [9], and in HTML using Bokeh [1]. Perprof-py can also be easily extended to be used with other plot libraries. It is implemented in Python 3 with support for internationalization, and is under the General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3).},
